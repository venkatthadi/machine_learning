9a51609b-7276-4d00-b496-ffa0489e5bc5,Dale Schaffer,It almost feels like the developers/product owners don't have children and don't actually use the app. It has a lot of features but as a parent managing children's devices the features don't really work for me. Apps should be categorised. A child should have X minutes a day playing games. Not X minutes per game. Certain apps should remain unlocked even when device is automatically locked (and not manually locked as currently set).,1

With the Family Link app, I can allow what I feel is acceptable for him, and it doesn't get out of control. I love it.",5

Google provides instructions to do so through the app, but the app doesn't have the option mentioned in the directions. Only option is to create a new account for my teenager, losing his existing games and apps.",2
