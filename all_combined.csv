Dowloaded, paid, and programmed three tablets and linked up two with apps, 'timeout' time etc. I started testing, the spontaneous 'timeout' never worked, so I looked for the FAQ's, nothing on that, then I came to look at the reviews. The developer responses with their dripping sarcasm and condescension convinced me it was not worth trying to support this start up with my business. So determined to cut my losses - 2 hours - of programming kids accounts, I tried to uninstall, thought i was successful one one, but then the other kid's tablets then locked down with countdowns, the first was a two hour countdown, i tried contacting for help, they just told me to go into settings, which can't be done in lockdown. In the end only way to get in is once that count down has stopped and i have just found this morning, two weeks later that the first tablet is now locked down for 5 and a half hours.

But my app, online and what my kids app show doesn't match in terms of use, time, location etc. I reported it the first day to IT and it literally takes them 24 hrs to respond to one email. So both my child and I are frustrated by restrictions and not understanding the reasoning when nothing matches. I'm over it not working already. IT is not customer friendly either. I'm over it.",1,Kaspersky SafeKids
