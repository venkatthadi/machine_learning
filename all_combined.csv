Dowloaded, paid, and programmed three tablets and linked up two with apps, 'timeout' time etc. I started testing, the spontaneous 'timeout' never worked, so I looked for the FAQ's, nothing on that, then I came to look at the reviews. The developer responses with their dripping sarcasm and condescension convinced me it was not worth trying to support this start up with my business. So determined to cut my losses - 2 hours - of programming kids accounts, I tried to uninstall, thought i was successful one one, but then the other kid's tablets then locked down with countdowns, the first was a two hour countdown, i tried contacting for help, they just told me to go into settings, which can't be done in lockdown. In the end only way to get in is once that count down has stopped and i have just found this morning, two weeks later that the first tablet is now locked down for 5 and a half hours.

Ive installed it on my child's tablet and my tablet, logged in to both and yet it refuses to recognise my child's device. Plus as others have said, the installation process and use is painfully counter-intuitive, often with vague buttons with no text to say what to do. Has anyone except the deluded product owner at Kaspersky actually tried to use it? And how do I block a specific app and not every app in that category? Appalling app - Shop elsewhere.",1,Kaspersky SafeKids

I will give five stars when the location feature works accurately; when the app updates the installed apps (hasn't happened once yet); and changes made in parent access update on child device (I have found restarting child's phone seems to help this a bit). Smoother accurate functioning needed across entire app, please. Still love the app, everything else works well and is super helpful. Please fix slow and lack of updating in app, and location accuracy. Thanks!",3,Kaspersky SafeKids

Good: * Nice and easy interface to set time limits - both as overall time and as time windows. * Both are easy to toggle: you do not lose the settings when disabling the limit. * Child request of time or access to a website appears as notification - if child is on a mobile device. * Much cheaper than Qus... and single license independent on number of children. Bad: * Requests from a computer will NOT appear in the app. Yes: you have the control app on your telephone but still the only way to answer child's request is via a browser on their website. I raised a ticket with support for this. * The algorithm that shows what applications are manageable does not do any cleanup. If you experiment with the child, the list quickly becomes unmanageable. The applications do not disappear after uninstalling. There is no way to hide them. Raised ticket for that.",3,Kaspersky SafeKids
