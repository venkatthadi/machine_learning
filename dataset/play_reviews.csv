They stand behind their product for certain! How refreshing, these days, when it seems like no one takes pride in customer service and employers don't really care who they hire. Not Mobicip. They definitely stand apart from all others.",5,0,2024-02-26 14:15:52,,,

12,37034fdb-ecf4-48cb-a0c5-35c9c03d2f49,Jeff P,Mobicip is the best parental control app I have used. I tried multiple parental control apps including all the big names before trying Mobicip. Mobicip was by far the best. It was the easiest to install. It provides a very easy dashboard that has lots of good information and usage to it. And their support is amazing. I submit a question and a real person provides real helpful responses in less than 24 hours. What more could you ask for.,5,3,2023-11-03 18:37:03,,,2.1.30_r668

Dowloaded, paid, and programmed three tablets and linked up two with apps, 'timeout' time etc. I started testing, the spontaneous 'timeout' never worked, so I looked for the FAQ's, nothing on that, then I came to look at the reviews. The developer responses with their dripping sarcasm and condescension convinced me it was not worth trying to support this start up with my business. So determined to cut my losses - 2 hours - of programming kids accounts, I tried to uninstall, thought i was successful one one, but then the other kid's tablets then locked down with countdowns, the first was a two hour countdown, i tried contacting for help, they just told me to go into settings, which can't be done in lockdown. In the end only way to get in is once that count down has stopped and i have just found this morning, two weeks later that the first tablet is now locked down for 5 and a half hours. I fully expect that the charm of the developer might come into play as I post this, but truly. Beware. I work in digital comms, so am not a luddite, and I can't figure this out.

UPDATE: Apparently this company tries to trick you into giving a good review with the promise of a gift card from Amazon. I had no problem writing a good review, because I really did like the product (and I wouldn't lie in a review anyway). But, since writing the review, the company will not answer any of my emails (before the review, they responded within one day - often much sooner). There has also been no gift card, and the only email reply I did get was when I threatened to remove my review since they were now completely unreachable. In that email they apologized and said to give them a day or two longer and the gift card would be coming. Well, that was 11 days ago, and still no word - even with my sending another email to check the status. It is unfortunate, because the product did work for me - but obviously this company is unscrupulous, so therefore I cannot recommend their product anymore.

Web pages do not load or they are blank altogether. It is very poor planning by Mobicip to not support the old software but have no available updates for Android. I paid for this software and my browser is useless. Also I will not be satisfied with Mobicip's lousy response about an update being available for Android soon. It has been over an week and still no update. Several responses to other reviews by Mobicip said that an update would by out by Thursday. It is Thursday and still no update. Overall I would give the old software about a 2 or 3 to be nice when it was working correctly. The old software was very glitchy from the start with many issues. Update since my last review & after the most recent software update. I would give this app zero stars if I could. There are multiple issues with the new update that need to be addressed. I do not know where to start. First off Mobicip has very poor customer service. I am surprised that this company is still in business with the customer service that they provide to customers that actually pay to use their services. I do not anticipate that this company will be in business much longer if their customer service remains this bad. After nearly two weeks of e-mails back and forth with Mobicip support, I still have no answers and resolution to the issues I been having with Mobicip. The response from support is always that we will check with our dev team about the issues that you might be having & will get back to you with an update. Guess what? Support has never given me or my wife any updates after several e-mails. There have been multiple occurrences in which support has not e-mailed us back in several days. In fact I have been waiting 3 days for a response to one of my e-mail & still no response from Mobicip. My wife sent an e-mail to Mobicip almost 3 days ago and she has not heard anything back yet. Lastly, Mobicip does not call you back when try to set up an apoointment to have a representative contact you. My wife set something up for call last week from Mobicip & they never called her. If you are thinking about purchasing Mobicip, please think twice before you do. Some problems that I am having with Mobicip after the new update is that the software is very buggy. The VPN cuts out intermittently & internet surfing can be annoying at times. When there is an open or active internet browser window and the VPN connection is lost, Mobicip does not filter or block websites that should be blocked. It will block access to internet browsers that are not open when the VPN fails which it should do. Mobicip does not block the Google App or Google Assistance app once the VPN connection is lost. The internet can be searched and accessed through both these Google apps when the VPN is lost. It is not my phone that is having problems with the VPN. I have a very good cellular phone coverage in my area. I have a Verizon plan with unlimited data. These VPN issues happen over Wifi too. I have re-installed Mobicip multiple times on my phone and it has not fixed the above issues. Something must be done soon to resolve these problems or I will be switching to a different company to filter the internet.",1,4,2018-10-06 00:45:37,The update is live now.

398,4f246a1c-c931-4f37-8d18-9fc1a8804428,A Google user,"Mobicep, along with all other apps like it, are a good attempt at controlling children online. I agree that the internet can have many dangerous and potentially scary things that children may see, but the simple fact is that nothing can ever fully control what someone else is doing online. I am an adult now, but a few years ago, my parents put Mobicep on my phone, and all I had to do to get uncensored internet access was to run the phone in Safe Mode. I was also able to get their passwords by installing a keylogger on my own computer, giving me full administrative power. I could even block my parents phones and computers, if I had wanted to. My parents also used other filters, all of which I could disable in at least 2 different ways. I guess my point is, is that if you have a really sharp kid, this app, or any others like it, are not going to do squat. But maybe that's not the end of the world, maybe kids can learn for themselves what's safe and what isn't. Maybe, instead of trying to hide the world from them, you could explain the dangers of the internet, and tell them what to stay away from. Because they are going to get uncensored access sooner or later, why use some censorship app when you could do a far more useful, and foolproof way of protecting your kids: talk to them about the internet. What a novel concept!",3,1,2018-09-12 14:16:48,"Fair point Jordan. But not all kids can use the internet responsibly, so that's the reason there's a need for services like Mobicip. An open conversation along with Mobicip can help ease children into a responsible use of an open internet.

399,7ae50a96-106c-49be-bf26-f0f0010ea025,A Google user,"Hello, I am writing this review mainly because of the issues I have been experiencing with your browser lately. I believe they are important fixes for your app, and I will do my best to explain them. Firstly, I want to address that I am not an annoyed kid here to ask for a way to disable or bypass any of the restrictions this app provides, as I find the restrictions to work well. I completely understand the importance of them. However, and this may vary between users, the app has frequently frozen my phone, preventing me from turning my phone off in some cases. It hasn't been as frequent lately, but it's a problem nonetheless. Secondly, the browser, as of last update, has been malfunctioning. Simple sites I've been able to go to in the past, even looking up an image, has not worked for some reason. Most of the time the page won't load, and whenever it does, clicking on any image or video, anything that would direct me to another page, doesn't load properly either. This is sad, as I have been unable to look up reference pictures for art, or look up music on YouTube. If there is any way you can fix these issues, please do. Thank you for reading this, and I wish you best of luck to improve the app to your abilty. Yours truly, Guy who wrote a review.",3,1,2018-09-08 19:35:10,"Hi Ezekiel,

access and you approving is helpful. But overall this is a poor service. 
You can easily view inappropriate material by using alternative web search 
engines (other than Google) and using the image search. We brought this up 
and mobicip's advice was to block duckduckgo... Which is useless because 
another search engine could be used anyway. We even blocked every possible 
category and it doesn't help. On the contrary, we only found one service 
that by blocking all categories also blocks all search engines. A shady 
thing about Mobicip is that you cannot cancel a free trial through the 
site. You have to submit a contact to them. And then they take their time 
processing it so you are charged prior to the cancellation going through. 
How difficult can it really be to offer it through the site? If it is this 
difficult, then don't make it auto renew. Other services do not do this. We
