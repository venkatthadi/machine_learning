This app made my son cry very often because even its basic function ""locking and unlocking device by parent"" works not every time, with delays, and sometimes just doesn't. One more thing.

It was working okay but considerably got worse after updates. Also performance not slightly changed with the latest update. Even though the other party has 100% mobile connection + wifi is closed, it mostly shows the location as offline. Useless!!!",1

Ability to manage multiple devices (e.g., tablet and phone) for a single child account. 2. Ability to config multiple unlock/lock times (different per device/day), e.g., device unlocked between 7am and 8am, and between 4pm and 6pm (example for illustration). 3. Ability to send a brief popup message (e.g. 'Dinner's ready') which child has to acknowledge. Thanks!",3
