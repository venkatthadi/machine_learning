The apps that do work load very slowly due to the poorly designed content filter over VPN connection. This company has failed to produce a working product for what has been years now. Forget contacting their ""support"", as they give no real helpful suggestions and could care less if they resolve your issue or not.",1
73df289d-feb5-41cc-9788-a9e5c918c0c6,Justin (Personal),"Installation was complicated, including unexplained security settings (it uses VPN stub to monitor Internet traffic). Settings to control the app are quite detailed, but not well presented and hard to figure out, especially scheduling. UI is juvenile and unhelpful. Worst of all, it failed repeatedly to shut off the devices when it was supposed to and denied access when it wasn't supposed to. On a positive note, they responded promptly when I asked for a refund, a few days after I installed it.",1

I know ios is notoriously difficult to lock down, but the app description made it seem to be the answer. With the iPhone, Net Nanny regularly and continuously stops connecting with my kids' iPhones.

I'm talking about within seconds and my phone hasn't even left my hand so I know it's not my kids doing it. Plus, when you enter websites that you want blocked, it doesn't work. To top it all off, the internet doesn't stop when time is up unless my kids close all open windows which is NOT going to happen b/c they have figured out that if they leave the tabs open they can get back on any time.",1

It actually works good on computers and laptops but especially on IOS phones, it works terribly. I constantly have problems and can never find appropriate directions to fix any of my problems.

When you look at an app it should take you to that app in the Play Store. Needs to show what websites they're on, not just what has been blocked. Notifications need to be broken up. So you can get notified when an app is installed but not get spammed when a site is blocked. For a paid app it's really light on features. Cannot recommend in its current state.",2
