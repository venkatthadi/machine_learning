It should be fine at least for activity monitoring but I seem to fail to use it properly even so. For PC usage, permission requests arrive late or never come in some cases. If I do manage to allow use of an app, after re-launching that app I have to approve it once again. Untill I approve it, said app obviously fails to launch so it's an endless loop.",1

Most of all I can see where they are, have been, and even tell them if they need to charge the battery in their iphones, and I'm using Android without issues. Happily interfaces our mixed device platform family, so everyone can use their preferred device while I still can control what I want. One can restrict so much it will make you miserable!",4

However, I can't select my kids right now to allow time through the app, neither can my husband. I don't know what happened. My husband can access it online but not through the app. We've been using it for 3 years.",3

A few day later i made another attempt and was able to uninstall this app from my device HOWEVER, my daughter's device, we tried to first deactivate and then uninstall but we keep getting a message when we click on the deactivate button that we must deactivate. I do not appreciate the grey hairs caused by this app. üòù",1

I set the time for my kids to play a game 30 minutes perday but they can play it forever. On the android device, my kids not able to add a new google account until i uninstall this apps. During blocking mode, in some condition, the kids not able to access all allowed apps. I sent email to Kaspersk describing the problems but they only asked more and more info without any solution.",2

fbb24d90-9c8f-43a6-8cbd-2ac4f14351f3,Z K,"The app is OK for setting limits on time and allowed apps on child's Android device. Integration with the Windows application is lacking. Good: * Nice and easy interface to set time limits - both as overall time and as time windows. * Both are easy to toggle: you do not lose the settings when disabling the limit. * Child request of time or access to a website appears as notification - if child is on a mobile device. * Much cheaper than Qus... and single license independent on number of children. Bad: * Requests from a computer will NOT appear in the app. Yes: you have the control app on your telephone but still the only way to answer child's request is via a browser on their website. I raised a ticket with support for this. * The algorithm that shows what applications are manageable does not do any cleanup. If you experiment with the child, the list quickly becomes unmanageable. The applications do not disappear after uninstalling. There is no way to hide them. Raised ticket for that.",3

e6b09961-1948-4b89-80ec-fba387363520,T Bur,I really like this for controlling my son's tablet during school hours. The scheduling / blocking section could be updated to show a linear schedule just to make it easier. So far it's doing what I need and limiting all apps other than the school apps required during school hours. I think for the cost it's very feature rich and notifies you instantly when things are happening on the device.,5

d831943c-f133-4b34-bd03-1fe8971593c6,gary howard,Id love a refund i will be stopping paying for this. The gps is dodgy also dosent work half the time. And the cross platform dose not work if u have android and ios every ios update messes up the app. And restricts features ur paying for. To this day i have not been able to locate the child that has an ios device. Android to android works but not great.,1

Do not buy this, take it from me, so frustrating!! And tech support always will say, go to settings and enable logging events or some lame excuse not to help you. Fyi, i tried that, but thats not my job the subscribers fix this please!!!",1
