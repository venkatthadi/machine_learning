They stand behind their product for certain! How refreshing, these days, when it seems like no one takes pride in customer service and employers don't really care who they hire. Not Mobicip. They definitely stand apart from all others.",5

They control all of the functions in your devices when you install the app and make an account a third party is in control of all the devices that you are using that app on so if you have three kids and you're trying to control the things that they see and you get this app thinking it'll help you.

37034fdb-ecf4-48cb-a0c5-35c9c03d2f49,Jeff P,Mobicip is the best parental control app I have used. I tried multiple parental control apps including all the big names before trying Mobicip. Mobicip was by far the best. It was the easiest to install. It provides a very easy dashboard that has lots of good information and usage to it. And their support is amazing. I submit a question and a real person provides real helpful responses in less than 24 hours. What more could you ask for.,5

When I tried to unlock so I could change settings (just to get setup) it said to check the internet connection.

Dowloaded, paid, and programmed three tablets and linked up two with apps, 'timeout' time etc. I started testing, the spontaneous 'timeout' never worked, so I looked for the FAQ's, nothing on that, then I came to look at the reviews. The developer responses with their dripping sarcasm and condescension convinced me it was not worth trying to support this start up with my business. So determined to cut my losses - 2 hours - of programming kids accounts, I tried to uninstall, thought i was successful one one, but then the other kid's tablets then locked down with countdowns, the first was a two hour countdown, i tried contacting for help, they just told me to go into settings, which can't be done in lockdown. In the end only way to get in is once that count down has stopped and i have just found this morning, two weeks later that the first tablet is now locked down for 5 and a half hours. I fully expect that the charm of the developer might come into play as I post this, but truly. Beware. I work in digital comms, so am not a luddite, and I can't figure this out.

The only thing I have seen successfully was when my kid's phone installed an app.  After the latest upgrade, I don't even see that on my phone.  I've only seen a couple of websites come up and I know the websites he's been on.  I've never seen any videos he's watched show up in his history.   Today I get the digest with no activity to report.  Most of the time I can't locate the phone.  Even with the phone sitting right next to me.    I've opened two tickets and so far no resolution or even suggestion to try anything.   Tech support so far has been a joke.",1

Despite her being on the phone for most of her waking hours, the screentime tracker shows a bare 45 mins. I keep getting locked out of my account, and resetting my password doesn't help either. No redeeming factors as far as my experience goes.",1

NO tracked history WHATSOEVER. I always get an email about ""your childs browsing history"" & it always says ""no history"". My child uses his phone EVERYDAY for multiple reasons yet mobicip says there's nothing. I tried to wait & give it time, thinking it would just take time to kick in & start tracking his phone history. NOPE. SMH. This app is just a scam. DO NOT INSTALL.",1
